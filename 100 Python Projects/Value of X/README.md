Description:
Jack's teacher gave him a ton of equations for homework. The thing is they are all kind of same so they are boring.

So help him by making a equation solving function that will return the value of x.

Test Cases will be like this:

# INPUT            # RETURN
'x + 1 = 9 - 2'    # 6
'- 10 = x'         # -10
'x - 2 + 3 = 2'    # 1
'- x = - 1'        # 1
All test cases are valid.
Every +, - and numbers will be separated by space.
There will be only one x either on the left or right.
x can have a - mark before it.
returned object will be a integer.
